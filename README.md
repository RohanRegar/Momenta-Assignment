About the repository - https://github.com/media-sec-lab/Audio-Deepfake-Detection  
The repository is a curated collection dedicated to audio deepfake detection. It aggregates a wide range of research papers, datasets, and tools related to detecting synthetic and spoofed audio. The resource is designed to serve both researchers and practitioners by offering theoretical insights and practical resources in one place.
Audio Large Models and Their Role
The repository provides an overview of various large-scale audio models along with their corresponding research papers. These models, such as AudioLM, VALL-E, and SpeechGPT, illustrate how synthetic audio is generated. By analyzing the patterns and differences between real and fake audio produced by these models, researchers can better understand the inherent characteristics of deepfakes and use that knowledge to design more effective detection systems.
Datasets and Noise Resources
A comprehensive list of popular datasets for audio deepfake detection is included, detailing not only the type of data and the quantity available but also the specific work conducted on each dataset. In addition, the repository offers a collection of noise datasets, which are essential for augmenting training data. By introducing realistic noise conditions into the models, researchers can enhance the robustness and real-world applicability of deepfake detection systems.
Detection Methodologies
The repository categorizes detection methodologies into several classes based on feature extraction and learning strategies:
•	Handcrafted Feature-based Detection:
Uses expert-designed features (e.g., MFCC, LFCC) with classical machine learning approaches.
•	Hybrid Feature-based Detection:
Combines handcrafted features with features learned directly from data, leveraging both interpretability and data-driven insights.
•	End-to-end Detection:
Bypasses manual feature extraction by processing raw audio directly through deep learning models that learn optimal representations autonomously.
•	Feature Fusion-based Detection:
Integrates multiple types of features (such as spectral, temporal, and prosodic) to capture complementary information that improves detection accuracy.
Evaluation Metrics
The performance of deepfake detection models is primarily evaluated using two metrics:
1.	Equal Error Rate (EER):
o	Expressed as a percentage, where lower values indicate better performance.
o	It is the point at which the false acceptance rate equals the false rejection rate.
o	Rankings (shown in parentheses, e.g., "(11)" or "(4)") indicate a model's relative performance within its category.
2.	tandem Detection Cost Function (t-DCF):
o	A specialized metric for spoofing countermeasures that assesses both detection performance and its impact on the overall verification system.
o	Lower t-DCF values represent superior performance.

Testing Scenarios
The repository distinguishes between two key testing scenarios in audio deepfake detection:
•	Logical Access (LA):
This scenario focuses on synthetic speech attacks that are digitally generated and directly injected into the system. The attacks do not involve any physical transmission; they are purely digital manipulations created through voice synthesis or conversion technologies.
•	Physical Access (PA):
In this scenario, the focus is on replay attacks. These occur when an attacker records a genuine user's voice and replays it through a physical medium (such as a speaker) to deceive the system. This setup involves actual acoustic transmission, making the detection process more challenging.

o	Analysis of real conversations
